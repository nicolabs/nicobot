# This image is based on Alpine linux in the hope of acheiving a minimum memory footprint.
# There isn't a consensus on using alpine with Python :
# - https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python
# - https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-3-biggest-wins-when-using-alpine-as-a-base-docker-image
# However it may help reclaim some MB on low-end computers like Raspberry Pi...

    # Rust is a requirement to build the 'cryptography' Python module
    # The recommended procedure is to use 'rustup' but Alpine ships with packages
    # for more CPU architectures so we use the OS' packages.
    # At the time of writing rustup only provides installers for x86_64 and
    # aarch64 (arm64) with *musl* (i.e. Alpine).

# STAGE 2 : Final image

# The base image must provide :
# - Python version > 3.4.2
# - bash
# - glibc
FROM python:3-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Runtime packages requirements
#
# libressl-dev : seems required for python to locate modules, or for omemo ?
# bash is to use extended syntax in entrypoint.sh (in particular tee >(...))
RUN apk add --no-cache libressl-dev bash

# Not used currently (we just copy the /root/.local directory which has everyting thanks to the --user option)
#COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/wheels ./wheels

ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
# All Python files, including nicobot's ones
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local/

# This script allows :
# - packaging several bots in the same image (to be cleaner they could be in
#   separate images but they're so close that it's a lot easier to package and
#   does not waste space by duplicating layers)
# - also adds extra command line options for Signal device linking
# Otherwise the ENTRYPOINT would simply be [ "python"]
